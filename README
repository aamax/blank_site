This application is a starting point for basic rails pages that offers user
model/view/controller support.  this was built from an existing site and cleaned
up - hopefully most/all of the non-user relevant items have been cleaned out well
but there may be some extraneous crap left over (no guarantees on that one)

The basics are built on the user model form Michael Hartl's tutorial.  It has been ported
to rails 3.1.x

User demographic data is kept for basic info like address, phone etc.  
users can edit and manage their own data 
only admin users can edit other users data.
only admin users can delete users.

specific sites should use this as a starting place and then expand site
functionality from here.

the current setup is configured to use postgresql
	the db name is mthost_development or mthost_test for those environments
		it is configured (for prodution) to work with heroku
	it's also configured to use environment variables for the user and passwords
		to keep security out of the repository.
		
PAGES:
	home - includes headers and footers as well as a partial for
		signed in and not signed in
	about - basic dummy about page
	signup - page to allow users to create an account
	signin - page to allow users to log in
			logins use email addresses
			passwords are encrypted and use a salt key for added security
			sessions are managed with cookies and the user will be remembered 
				indefinitely in this version
	signout - page/link to log user out and clean up cookies/session/ etc.
	construction - a page to stub out future feature/page expansions
	
user model:
	the model has support for demographic info and the notion of an admin user
		or a teamleader user.

rake task: db:populate
	this task will use a userdata.csv file found in the parent dir to the project
	to populate the development database with data.  
	
RSpec Tests:
	rspec tests are in place to ensure the user model etc. is solid
